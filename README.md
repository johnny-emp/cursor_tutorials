# Reflective Token Contract

This README provides an overview of the Reflective Token Contract, a smart contract that implements a token with buy and sell taxes, reflections, and customizable functionality.

## Features

1. **Token Address**: The contract has a settable token address.
2. **Buy and Sell Taxes**: Configurable tax rates for buying and selling transactions.
3. **Reflections**: A portion of the taxes is distributed as reflections to token holders.
4. **Customizable Function**: The remaining portion of the taxes can be allocated to a user-defined function.

## Key Components

### Token Address
The token address is set during contract deployment or can be updated by the contract owner.

### Buy and Sell Taxes
- Buy Tax: Applied when users purchase tokens.
- Sell Tax: Applied when users sell tokens.

Both taxes are configurable and can be adjusted by the contract owner.

### Reflections
A percentage of the buy and sell taxes is automatically distributed to all token holders as reflections. This incentivizes holding the token and rewards long-term holders.

### User-Defined Function
The remaining portion of the taxes (after reflections) is allocated to a customizable function. This allows for flexible use of the collected taxes, such as:
- Liquidity provision
- Marketing wallet funding
- Burn mechanism
- Any other functionality as defined by the contract deployer

## Usage
To interact with this token contract:
1. Set the token address (if not set during deployment).
2. Configure the buy and sell tax rates.
Set the reflection percentage.
4. Implement the user-defined function for the remaining tax allocation.
Please refer to the contract's functions and events for detailed information on how to interact with and monitor the token's behavior.

## Security Considerations
Ensure that only authorized addresses can modify tax rates and other sensitive parameters.
Implement safeguards to prevent excessive taxation that could impede token transfers.
Thoroughly test the user-defined function to avoid potential vulnerabilities or unintended behavior.

## Disclaimer
This token contract involves complex mechanisms. Users and developers should exercise caution and conduct thorough testing and auditing before deploying or interacting with the contract on any blockchain network.
