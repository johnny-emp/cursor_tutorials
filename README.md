# Demo Project

This project aims to build a to-do application with the following features:

1. User can create a list of to-dos
2. Each to-do item includes:
   - Task description
   - Completion status
   - Deadline
3. User can:
   - Add new to-dos
   - Delete existing to-dos
   - Mark to-dos as completed
4. Data persists in local storage, allowing it to remain after page refresh
5. No authentication system required

The application will use browser-level persistence for data storage.
